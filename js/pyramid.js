/* Role mining over the organisation's own shape.

   The bundle miner in roles.js asks "which entitlements travel together?" and answers
   without knowing anything about people. That finds real bundles, but it cannot say who
   should get them, so every proposal still needs a human to invent a condition.

   This does the opposite. It takes the attributes HR already maintains — employer,
   department, title, location, contract type — and orders them from broad to specific
   into a pyramid. Every person lands in exactly one path down that pyramid, and an
   entitlement that nearly everyone under a node holds becomes a rule *at that node*.
   Rules are placed as high as they hold, and never repeated below, so the model reads
   the way an access model is written by hand: everyone gets these, this department adds
   those, this title adds one more.

   What the pyramid cannot explain is as interesting as what it can:
     under-entitled   people in a node who lack what their node grants
     pollution        access nobody around them has, held by one person
     combinations     patterns that cut across the hierarchy — a title that gets the
                      same tool in every department — mined separately and added on top

   The approach is adopted from the role-analytics prototype; what is new here is that
   the entitlement weights come from this tool's own category sensitivity and price book,
   so the pyramid is pulled toward the attributes that govern expensive and dangerous
   access rather than treating every group as equal. */

   * can only mine a title inside a department, so a job title that gets the same access
   * in every department has to be rediscovered once per department or not at all. That
   * is a real limitation, and on a tenant where access follows job titles across the
   * organisation it loses to a flat miner outright.
   *
   * So when coverage is the goal, this ignores the hierarchy: every attribute value and
   * every pair of them is a candidate condition, and rules are taken greedily by how many
   * assignments they explain that nothing chosen so far explains. The baseline is seeded
   * first by construction rather than by competition — it is the rule an administrator
   * writes anyway, and everything after it should be what the baseline does not cover.
   *
   * The pyramid keeps its own value: it is legible, it nests the way an organisation
   * describes itself, and its levels are what a person can argue about. This is the
   * answer when the question is coverage rather than structure.
