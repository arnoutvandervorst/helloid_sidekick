/* Roles from HR alone.

   The pyramid needs to see access: its levels are chosen by how much of the granted
   entitlements they explain. With only a vault loaded there is nothing to explain yet —
   but the condition half of a business rule needs no access at all. Which departments,
   titles and locations exist, and how they combine, is already in the contracts, and a
   consultant can draft the rule skeleton from that before a single target system is
   connected. Entitlements attach later, on aggregate, once the reconciliation arrives.

   That last step is what the proposal has to serve. Entitlements only attach cleanly
   to a group whose members are alike enough to share access, so a rule for everybody
   places everyone and says nothing, and a rule set is worth more the more specific it
   is. Two numbers carry that:

     placed       people under at least one rule that fits HelloID's rule cap — a rule
                  set that needs 260 rules is judged on the 100 it can actually have
     alike        how much of what decides access the rule pins down. Every attribute
                  carries a weight for how much it decides access — a job title most,
                  a department or team a fair amount, a location or contract type a
                  little. An attribute the rule conditions on counts in full; one it
                  leaves open counts by how much more the members agree on it than
                  everybody does (lift over the population). So a job-title rule is
                  alike across a hundred departments, because the title is the job;
                  a department rule is alike only if its people share a title too; a
                  rule for everyone is 0. An attribute nobody shares anywhere (a cost
                  centre per person) neither helps nor drags.

   Rule count is not a cost. More rules is more specific; the only limit is the cap.
   An attribute that cannot group even half the people at the minimum size — a cost
   centre per person — describes individuals, not roles. It is left out of the rules
   and out of the alikeness measure, and the view says so.

   Groups become rules the way HelloID can hold them:

     merge        sibling groups share one rule with a "one of" list as long as the
                  shared rule is still alike enough — three wards with the same titles
                  and the same site are one rule, not three. A ward of two joins its
                  siblings and is placed, where alone it was too small to defend.

   Not every person is worth the same slot. A person who joined, moved or left in the
   last year counts double — that is the join, move or leave a rule would have handled,
   and where a rule set pays. A person in the long tail of job titles counts half: the
   job titles are ordered by headcount, the ones that together hold 80% of people are
   the core — operational by construction, nurses and helpers and drivers — and the
   rest is the long tail: controllers, jurists, one-offs, project work, which is better
   served by self-service than by rules. No word list, no HR vocabulary: mass alone.
   How concentrated the titles are is itself the headline — healthcare puts 80% of its
   people in a few dozen titles, government spreads them over hundreds.

   Where the vault carries the department hierarchy, the hierarchy is the natural
   layering: a rule on a level-2 unit is a generic rule for the whole branch, a rule
   on a leaf department the specialisation. Each level becomes an attribute of its own
   (Org1, Org2, …); a combination holds at most one of them, and in alikeness the
   levels share the department's weight so the hierarchy counts once. HelloID cannot
   condition on "under Wijkzorg", but the walker spells it out as a "one of" list of
   every department beneath — which is exactly what the export writes.

   No real access model uses one attribute, so the proposal is built as a set: every
   merged rule from every combination is a candidate, and rules are taken layer by
   layer — every single-attribute rule worth a
   slot first, then the two-attribute rules that add something on top of them, then
   three — each by how much more alike it makes the people it covers than the rules
   already taken do. The cap is a depth budget spent from the top of that pyramid:
   what the mix ends up being — titles here, department-and-title there, department
   underneath — is what the data supports, and the cap decides how far down it goes.

   The rules carry a condition list and the people it selects, in the same shape the
   pyramid's condensed rules use, so the day access is loaded the two can be matched
   on identity. */
