/* The product's version and release history, as data.

   Scheme is CalVer: YYYY.M.N — year, month, Nth release within that month
   (N resets when the month rolls over). One release = one deployed change
   set; there is no build step, so this file IS the source of truth: the
   topbar, the Settings About card, the in-app changelog drawer and the
   generated CHANGELOG.md all read from here.

   Bump rule: when a change set ships, add a new entry at the TOP of ENTRIES
   and regenerate the markdown with `NODE_OPTIONS= node make-changelog.js`.
   Entry text is English release notes — content, not UI chrome — so it is
   deliberately outside the i18n dictionaries.

   The first twelve entries are a retroactive read of the git history
   (104 commits, 2026-07-29 → 2026-08-28), grouped per feature arc. */

The simulation now asks for a vault export and says why; with one loaded, the Persons are the vault’s own.
